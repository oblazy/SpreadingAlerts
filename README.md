# SpreadingAlerts
Spreading Alerts Quietly over a sensor network


This script is a prototype associated with the paper "Spreading Alerts Quietly: New Insights from Theory and Practice" published at ARES'2018.

It is developped using the Charm framework: https://github.com/JHUISI/charm


### Nota Bene
I would not recommend to try and use it for real applications.
This script is provided as is, and using a python script based on a library dedicated to provide a wrapper of pbc may not prove to be the most efficient 

However, there should not be any blatant security issue... i hope

### To Do

- [x] Publish first version of the script
- [ ] Make it user friendly
- [ ] Switch to an efficient language
